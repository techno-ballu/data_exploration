> <i>They say that Data Science is the sexiest job of the 21st Century and rightly so. Data, be it structured or unstructured has power. The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight that could change the life of a patient, or change the world. </i>

#### The goal of this interactive application is to allow the user to play with data and intelligently recommend the user to make data science decisions using meta learning. This is an attempt to use machine learning to improve machine learning. 

#### Steps:

**Data**

Load a CSV file (later on load data from DB). Identify ID and targets. Checkout the metadata. Look at histograms of rows, columns and features. Identify outliers in histograms and clean them out interactively! Clean out near zero variance columns.

**Discovery**

Look at univariate, bivariate and multivariate relationships between the features and the target. Get rid of collinear and multi-collinear features using simple plots.

**Feature engineering**

Add new features!

**Transformations**

Perform numerical and categorical transformations.

**Impute missing values**

Impute missing values by mean / median.

**Slicing and ranking**

Select subset of data and important (ranked) features.

**Learning & Predictions**
